# HR Dashboard Insights and Recommendations - Power BI
### Overview
In recent years, organizations have increasingly recognized the importance of employee satisfaction as a key driver of performance and productivity. A high level of job satisfaction has been linked to increased employee engagement, reduced turnover, and improved organizational outcomes (Harter, J. K., Schmidt, F. L., & Hayes, T. L. (2002). The impact of workplace factors on employee satisfaction and organizational performance. *Journal of Applied Psychology, 87(2), 270-279).*
In this project I analyzed demographic data about employees of an organization and derived insights in Power BI. The dashboards include insights on employee satisfaction levels, performance rating, retrenchment and promotion status.
### Problem Statement:

Despite achieving a high performance ratings, the organization is facing significant employee dissatisfaction and attrition. This discrepancy between performance and satisfaction highlights a potential disconnect between individual contributions and organizational well-being.
In this project I will use 2 datasets that can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4bvZlHJUFAYJ5CbleAmLr6muAX1Q7rm/view)

## Insights
- Gender Diversity: The workforce is predominantly male (60%), with females making up 40%.

- Tenure: A significant portion (42%) of employees have less than 5 years of service, indicating a potentially high turnover rate. Employees with over 20 years of service are more likely to leave.

- Promotion: Only 5% of employees were due for promotion, suggesting a potential lack of career growth opportunities.

- Retrenchment: 117 employees (8%) were retrenched, with a higher percentage in senior and management positions (51%).

1. High-Performance Paradox:
A significant portion of employees (84%) achieved high performance ratings, particularly in Sales. However, a considerable number (68%) reported medium to low job satisfaction.
This suggests that high performance may not always translate to high job satisfaction.
2. Retrenchment Trends:
Retrenchment disproportionately affected individuals with medium to low satisfaction levels (75%). Managerial roles and Sales Executives accounted for a significant portion of retrenchments, indicating potential leadership and performance issues in these areas.
3. Promotion Disparity:
Only 5% of employees were due for promotion, highlighting a potential lack of career growth opportunities.
This, coupled with retrenchment, may contribute to employee dissatisfaction and turnover.

## Recommendations
1. Prioritize Employee Satisfaction:
Implement regular employee satisfaction surveys and feedback mechanisms to identify and address underlying issues.
Invest in employee well-being programs, such as stress management workshops and mental health resources.
Foster a positive work culture that values employee contributions and recognizes achievements.

2. Re-evaluate Performance Metrics:
Consider expanding performance metrics beyond individual results to include factors like teamwork, collaboration, and innovation.
Align performance evaluations with organizational goals and individual career aspirations.

3. Invest in Leadership Development:
Provide targeted leadership training to improve managerial skills, communication, and coaching abilities.
Encourage mentorship programs to support the development of emerging leaders.

4. Enhance Career Development Opportunities:
Create clear career paths and development plans for all employees.
Offer training and skill development programs to empower employees and prepare them for future roles.

5. Strengthen Communication Channels:
Improve communication between management and employees to foster transparency and trust.
Encourage open dialogue and feedback sessions to address concerns and build a sense of community.

#### Significance of the Analysis
This analysis is vital as it provides a data-driven understanding of workforce dynamics, enabling HR and management teams to address critical challenges. The insights highlight areas where intervention is necessary to improve employee engagement, reduce turnover, and foster a more supportive work environment. For example, focusing on satisfaction metrics allows the organisation to pinpoint factors contributing to dissatisfaction and retrenchment, while the promotion data helps identify gaps in career advancement. Addressing these issues can lead to increased employee morale, enhanced productivity, and better talent retention. Furthermore, improving diversity and inclusion can lead to a more balanced and innovative workforce, aligning with modern workplace standards and values.
By leveraging these insights, the organisation can implement targeted strategies that strengthen its workforce, ensuring both immediate improvements in employee engagement and long-term organisational success.
